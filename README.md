**NuyoRican Food Truck**
- A full-stack web application built for The NuyoRican Food Truck, designed to replace their preset GoDaddy site with a modern, functional, and dynamic web experience.

**Overview**
- This project was developed for a client who wanted a more flexible and interactive website for their food truck business.
- With this application, I provided the client a platform to display menu items dynamically and easily manage content through a secure admin dashboard.
- The site includes CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) that allows the client to update menu items and images without any technical knowledge.
- Moving forward, I plan to expand the project to include online ordering capabilities with DoorDash integration.

**Tech Stack**
- Frontend: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Next.js API Routes, NextAuth (Credentials)
- Database: PostgreSQL (Neon) with Prisma ORM
- Storage: Cloudinary
- Deployment: Vercel

**Key Features**
- Secure admin authentication for content management
- Dynamic menu loaded directly from the database
- Cloudinary integration for uploading and displaying images
- Responsive design for all devices
- Future feature: DoorDash integration for user orders

**My Role**
- I designed, developed, and deployed the entire application â€” from the database and authentication system to the responsive front-end layout and admin dashboard.
